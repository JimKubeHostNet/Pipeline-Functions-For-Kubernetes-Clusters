# Pipeline Functions For Kubernetes Clusters  
  
Pipeline Functions For Kubernetes Clusters is an open-source collection of functions that can be 
integrated with any Pipeline tool to create, update, and destroy Kubernetes clusters created by 
the Agile Cloud Manager.  This project is an element of the Agile Cloud Manager which will be 
released on GitHub and which will consume this.  
  
Pipeline Functions For Kubernetes Clusters is comprised of collections of Python Scripts and of 
Python Modules which in turn run Terraform commands on the cloud resources that are created and managed 
by the Agile Cloud Manager.  In this way, the code for performing basic tasks can be managed separately 
from your pipeline tool (Jenkins, Bamboo, Electric Flow, CircleCI, etc.) and you can thus more easily 
migrate between Pipeline tools.  
  
These functions and modules are designed to be consumed by elements of the Agile Cloud Manager, and thus 
clones of this repository are placed at different points in the code you can download from our other 
repositories.  
  
The primary development of Pipeline Functions For Kubernetes Clusters was done by
[Green River IT, Incorporated](http://greenriverit.com) in California.  It is released 
under the generous license terms defined in the [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt) file.
